# Pomodoro-Mobile
How to run the app:
•Pull from github
•Install packages - if you have node package manager (npm) run "npm i expo" and "npm install"
•Make sure you are in the Pomodoro-Mobile folder and run "expo start"
•Now you have options for how you want to actually run the app, as can be seen on the left of the browser that should pop up after running expo start. 
What I have done:
•Install "Expo" app on your phone
•Scan the QR code with your camera and the app should open on your phone
